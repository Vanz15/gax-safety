# GAX-Safety

This repository contains code for a thesis studying GAX-based safety metrics
for medical diagnostic models using Chest X-ray data.

The MIMIC-CXR dataset is stored externally on a secondary drive (D:) and is not included
in this repository. Dataset paths are configured via `src/config.py`.
